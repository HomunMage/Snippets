Exploring the future of coding with AI! Tools like GitHub Copilot, based on advanced AI models like Codex and GPT-3, are revolutionizing code assistance. Currently, our interactions with these models are stored on servers. However, I foresee a future where our AI chat histories are stored locally, allowing for more seamless integration with editors like VSCode. Imagine having a local AI assistant right in your code editor, offering real-time guidance, autocompletion, and more! The future of development looks exciting! üí°üñ•Ô∏è
